Welcome to Musical Chairs!

## About

This web app was made to help you keep track of songs and organize them on the fly, when you don't have time to search them up on your favorite streaming app.

## Future Enhancements

#### For future updates there's a few things I'd like to encorporate into this app. 

1. I would like to add the feature to import playlists and display pre-created playlists from other music streaming services with the use of an api. 
    - I believe this would help solidify the missing connection this app might be critisized for, as most people nowadays use music streaming apps to keep track of all this info already
2. I would love to create a method to show a full feed and create more unique interactions between users, allowing you to see others with similar music taste. 
3. Last, I think I would like to give this application a slightly more unique look and feel. It isn't harsh on the eyes but it never hurts to make yourself stand out a bit I believe.
